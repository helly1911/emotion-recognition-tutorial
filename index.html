        <p>The human brain with eyesight is quickly able to identify what exactly a person's emotion is. In today's hi-tech world, the demand for independent living is recognized in visually impaired people facing the central problem of social restrictiveness. They suffer in strange surroundings without any manual aid. Visual information is the basis for most utmost tasks, so visually impaired people are at a disadvantage because necessary information about the surrounding environment is not available. With the modern progressions in inclusive technology, it is achievable to spread the support given to people with visual impairment.  It will be a useful way for blind people to interact with the environment with technology guidance and utilize technology facilities.</p>
        <p>This project aims to help blind or visually impaired people using Machine Learning; we can predict the nature of facial expression using techniques such as Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Cascading. </p>
